Known as a "Crooner" in the 50's and 60's mostly with the Ray Conniff Orchestra tried his skills at Country Music in the early 70's.
This is the best version and arrangement (in MY opinion) of this song originally done by Bob Wills. It was released in 1973 I am assuming as the "B" side of Cajun Fiddler. We played this side on country radio. I searched You Tube high and low and couldn't find it by Don Cherry so I bought the 45 off eBay and transposed it to a MP3. Hope someone likes this version. Enjoy!

P.S. 
As of this writing Don Cherry is still alive at 94 living in Las Vegas Nevada.
